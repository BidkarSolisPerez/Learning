        Self-Review Exercises
        1.1 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:
        Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called programs.

        The key logical units of the computer are the input unit, output unit, CPU, ALU, memory unit and secondary memory.

        The three types of languages discussed in the chapter are Machine language, Assembly language and High level language.

        The programs that translate high-level language programs into machine language are called compilers.

        Android is an operating system for mobile devices based on the Linux kernel and Java.

        Release candidates software is generally feature complete, (supposedly) bug free and ready for use by the community.

        The Wii Remote, as well as many smartphones, use a(n) accelerometer which allows the device to respond to motion.

        1.2 Fill in the blanks in each of the following sentences about the Java environment:

        The java command from the JDK executes a Java application.

        The javac 13command from the JDK compiles a Java program.

        A Java source code file must end with the .java file extension.

        When a Java program is compiled, the file produced by the compiler ends with the .class file extension.

        The file produced by the Java compiler contains bytecodes that are executed by the Java Virtual Machine.

        1.3 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements (based on Section 1.5 ):

        Objects enable the design practice of encapsulation —although they may know how to communicate with one another across well-defined interfaces, they normally are not allowed to know how other objects are implemented.

        Java programmers concentrate on creating  classes, which contain fields and the set of methods that manipulate those fields and provide services to clients.

        The process of analyzing and designing a system from an object-oriented point of view is called OOAD.

        A new class of objects can be created conveniently by inheritance—the new class (called the subclass) starts with the characteristics of an existing class (called the superclass), possibly customizing them and adding unique characteristics of its own.

        Unified Modeling Language is a graphical language that allows people who design software systems to use an industry-standard notation to represent them.

        The size, shape, color and weight of an object are considered attributes of the object’s class.

        1.4 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:

        The logical unit that receives information from outside the computer for use by the computer is the Input unit.

        The process of instructing the computer to solve a problem is called programming.

        Assembly Language is a type of computer language that uses Englishlike abbreviations for machine-language instructions.

        Output unit is a logical unit that sends information which has already been processed by the computer to various devices so that it may be used outside the computer.

        Memory unit and storage unit are logical units of the computer that retain information.

        Arithmetic is a logical unit of the computer that performs calculations.

        Logic is a logical unit of the computer that makes logical decisions.

        High level languages are most convenient to the programmer for writing programs quickly and easily.

        The only language a computer can directly understand is that computer’s machine language.

        CPU is a logical unit of the computer that coordinates the activities of all the other logical units.

        1.5 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:

        The Java programming language is now used to develop large-scale enterprise applications, to enhance the functionality of web servers, to provide applications for consumer devices and for many other purposes.

        DOS initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.

        The TCP ensures that messages, consisting of sequentially numbered pieces called bytes, were properly routed from sender to receiver, arrived intact and were assembled in the correct order.

        The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Laboratories.

        1.6 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:

        Java programs normally go through five phases— edit, compile, load,verify and execute.

        A(n) IDE provides many tools that support the software development process, such as editors for writing and editing programs, debuggers for locating logic errors in programs, and many other features.

        The command java invokes the JVM, which executes Java programs.

        A(n) Virtual machine is a software application that simulates a computer, but hides the underlying operating system and hardware from the programs that interact with it.

        The class loader takes the .class files containing the program’s bytecodes and transfers them to primary memory.

        The bytecode veryfier examines bytecodes to ensure that they’re valid.

        1.7 Explain the two compilation phases of Java programs.
        1 Phase: Sour code is translated to bytecode
        2 Phase: Bytecode is translaged to mahine language which the code is currently running
        1.8 One of the world’s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation, interface and information hiding.
        First as class is something generic and most of the time is an abstraction for some concept that is almost a subject in this case the main concept is watch
        Is instrument that let us know the time and has some attributes and states like value of the current hour, minute and second. These states can be changed with some methods
        and they call other methdods that process the changes and will be executed by another methods that encapsulate the funtionality of this.  
        Now that the main concept has been applied we can create a different kind of watches, so class Watch just has the general classs definition and from them we can use inheritance
        to create subclases like wrist Watches that it will take some new functionalities like alarms, sensors to measure presuare or some others functionalities that will be new classes
        added to this new subclass from Watch class. In that way the world is just created from this Object Oriented Language paradigm.
